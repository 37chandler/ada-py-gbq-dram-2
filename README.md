# ADA: Python & GBQ with Dram Shop, Part 2

<!--
Assignment Version

This assignment continues the work from Part 1. In that part we read in
a single file into a Pandas dataframe, made some modifications to it, uploaded it to your GBQ instance, 
and queried it. 

In this assignment we go a bit further. Here we will process all of the items files from the zip `dram-items.zip`. Unzip these into a folder in your repo. Open them one at a time and make the same changes to some of the columns as you made in part 1. Then you'll upload the data, one month's worth of data at a time, to tables in your personal project and dataset. The tables will have the form `dram_items_YYYYMM01` to take advantage of GBQ's "sharding" of the data.

and queried it. 

In this exercise we go a bit further. Here we will process all of the items files from the zip `dram-items.zip`. Manually unzip these into a folder in your repo. Open them one at a time and make the same changes to some of the columns as you made in part 1. Then you'll upload the data, one month's worth of data at a time, to tables in your personal project and dataset. The tables will have the form `dram_items_YYYYMM01` to take advantage of GBQ's "sharding" of the data.
